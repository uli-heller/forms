# Forms Public API
This file contains the API-Documentation. For more information on the returned Data-Structures, please refer to the [corresponding Documentation](DataStructure.md).

## Generals
- Base URL for all calls to the forms API is `<nextcloud_base_url>/ocs/v2.php/apps/forms/api/v1`
- All Requests need to provide some authentication information.
- All Requests to OCS-Endpoints require the Header `OCS-APIRequest: true`
- Unless otherwise specified, all parameters are mandatory.

- By default, the API returns data formatted as _xml_. If formatting as _json_ is desired, the request should contain the header `Accept: application/json`. For simple representation, the output presented in this document is all formatted as _json_.
- The OCS-Endpoint *always returns* an object called `ocs`. This object contains an object `meta` holding some meta-data, as well as the actual data as value to the key `data`. In this document, the response-blocks only show the `data` Content, if not explicitely stated different.
```
"ocs": {
  "meta": {
    "status": "ok",
    "statuscode": 200,
    "message": "OK"
  },
  "data": <Actual data>
}
```
